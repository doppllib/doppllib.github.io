# Welcome to Doppl!

The Doppl philosophy can be summed up as:

- If users see it, make it native
- Otherwise, make it once

Doppl exists to help with the "make it once" part, by converting your
Android code into equivalent iOS code. While you will want to create a custom
iOS UI that adheres to iOS styles and conventions ("make it native"), you can
share much of the rest of your application logic between the two platforms
("make it once").
