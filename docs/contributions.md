# Contributing

Doppl is in a pretty early public preview state, so contributions are encouraged but we'll be making changes pretty quickly. Feedback and discussion highly encouraged. Please join our slack group or tweet at us.

## Gradle Plugin

[The gradle plugin](https://github.com/doppllib/doppl-gradle) is most likely to change quite a bit over the next few months. We're trying to keep the scope as narrow as possible. Contributions in the form of feedback are probably most useful at this point (and bug reports, of course). Tests are always welcome however, as we haven't done automated testing with the plugin.

## Android Extensions

[The Android extensions](https://github.com/doppllib/core-doppl) require some priority decisions with regards to what is/is not included. Feel free to add whatever you'd like from AOSP, but we may not want to add it to the core project. But reports, testing, additions to the testing tools are all welcome. Thoughts and feedback as well.

## Libraries

Additional libraries, and bug reports/fixes to existing libraries highly encouraged.
