    Doppl is a set of tools and libraries built on top of Google's J2objc. While J2objc is intentionally neutral with
    regards to Android, the Doppl ecosystem is designed to facilitate sharing logic and architecture
    between Android and iOS.

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    Follow the basic setup and app tutorial here.

    <h2>Components</h2>

    <h2>Conceptual Overview</h2>
    The "why" from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfhLBDuImOM">talk at Droidcon SF</a>.<br/>

    <h2>Status</h2>
    Doppl has been running under "technical preview" for the past several months. We've been
    gathering feedback and making modifications to the build system.<p/>
    <h3>Production Ready</h3>
    "Doppl" had a slightly modified J2objc build, but the modifications were really minor. Doppl runs fully
    stock J2objc as of latest source and presumably whenever version 2.0.6 is released, the downloaded stock version.
    The build system is going through revisions, but J2objc itself, and the libraries we're building on, are used
    in production with very high profile applications from a number of companies.
    <p/>
    The libraries are Android community standards, the Android architecture code is from AOSP directly. Doppl as an
    architectural sharing framework is production ready.<br/>
