<h2>Beta!</h2>
Doppl has been running under "technical preview" for the past several months. We've been
gathering feedback and making modifications to the build system. There will be ongoing changes
and likely bug fixes, but this will be mostly just for the gradle plugin itself. J2objc
has been stable and in production for years. We are currently shipping production apps
using the Doppl build system and libraries.
