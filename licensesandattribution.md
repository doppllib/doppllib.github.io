# Licenses

Doppl is made up of several parts. Here's a summary list of licenses, but refer to the actual repo for detail.

## J2ojbc

We maintain a fork of J2objc that retains the same license as the parent. The main project has an Apache 2.0 license, but I believe there are other parts of the source that have different licenses.

## Gradle Plugin

The Gradle plugin started life as a fork of the j2objc-gradle project, and retains the same Apache 2.0 license.

## Core Android Extensions

Much of this code originated from the AOSP, and unless otherwise stated, has an Apache 2.0 license.

## Forked Libraries

They all have their own licensing, but except for Sqlcipher, it's pretty much all Apache 2.0.
