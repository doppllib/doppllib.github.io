Download the Doppl 2.0.4 Runtime by clicking below. The runtime is distributed as a zip file containing the iOS frameworks, Java jars, and various other parts of the J2ojbc runtime. Extract this zip to somewhere on your drive and make note of the path for later configuration. **It is highly recommended that you extract to a path without spaces**
